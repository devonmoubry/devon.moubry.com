      <h2 class="project-title">TX Adventures</h2>
      <p>Texas Adventures is my final project completed in two weeks while I was a student at The Iron Yard Front-End Engineering Course.</p>
      <h3 class="minor-heading">Inspiration</h3>
      <p>I was inspired to work on this project because of a need that I have had when traveling and moving to new areas. Where to find a good hike and a great brunch spot to go to afterwards. I moved to Hawaii in 2012 and lived with my sister on Oahu. We went hiking on average once a week. We usually cooked Paleo at home, but every once in a while we went out to eat after our hikes. It was a part of the culture for many people on the island and visiting vacationers. Some genius woman in Honolulu thought of the idea to cater to people that want hiking and food without the hassle of planning and transportation. Hiking Hawaii will advise your, drive you, lead you on a hike, pack a picnic or take you back to the restaurant all for a fee. My sister and I immediately thought that we could do that for ourselves without having to pay locals to tell us where to go and what to do. Cinnamons, Cream Pot, Lanikai Juice, the list goes on. There are so many great places to eat with hikes nearby if you know where to go. We bought the book Hiking Hawaii to help tell us where to go. We became amazing tour guides for our friends, family, and random acquaintances that my sister would meet. When I moved back to Dallas, I wanted to continue the hiking tradition, but finding good places to hike seemed impossible in DFW. It took a lot of searching. Several places my friend Claire and I hiked were actually dirt bike trails, not exactly my idea of a good hike. Then I went on D Magazine's website and the Dallas Observer to look for good brunch restaurants to go to. It would take all week to plan out our Sunday Funday! Then I moved to Austin and became a front end engineer. My brother asked me what I spent most of my free time doing. He said that should be the inspiration for my first personal project. An app to pair hikes and brunches together was born there. I really thought that it would be silly and not worthy of a final project. However, my project was voted most likely to be used by everyone that saw it!
      <h3 class="minor-heading">Process</h3>
      <p>I began by thinking about what I would want in an app to help me plan a Sunday Funday. Then I began researching other mapping apps and websites with restaurants and hiking. I found that nothing grouped these two things together and that my idea was unique and interesting. I thought that I would do everything in one page and drew a wireframe for it after brainstorming all the features that I could think of. I presented my project idea to the group after 3 days of research and development. I also discussed the full potential of my app with my instructor. After it was approved I thought about the most important part of the app...the data. I wanted the hikes and restaurants in my app to be a perfect list of awesome Austin locations. I found an API called TrailsAPI to begin the hiking part of my app. However, after researching restaurants and API filters that were already available, I realized that I wanted to make my own API. This was a labor of love. As a front-end engineer I did not realize that the backend students know how to do this easily. I learned so much about APIs during this process. I say that creating this brunch API took a day and some hours. This is true. I spent my first full project day researching restaurants in the Austin area, asking for recommendations, looking at reviews in the Austin Chronicle, and determining what times these places served brunch.</p>

      <h3 class="minor-heading">Tech</h3>
      <p>This is a single page application using React-Redux. I used Mapbox to get the map, directions, icons, and icon filters. Mapbox was recommended by my little brother who is developer. There was very little documentation on implementing Mapbox with React-Redux, so this was a great learning opportunity. I learned a lot about how to do that using two reducers. I am using backendless to register and login users and also save favorite hikes and restaurants.  I can Google restaurants nearby, but I donâ€™t want Taco Bell.  I created my own restaurants API to include valuable planning information. I included a Foursquare ID with each restaurant to get updated restaurant information. I used lodash to filter the brunch and hike information.</p>
